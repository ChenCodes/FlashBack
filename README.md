App description: This is a memory game that tests how many moves you can remember in order to advance to the next level. 


#####Rules:
Number of players: 1 (or more, team effort)

To start the game, simply press down on the little character that appears in one of the blocks momentarily. After you successfully press on the correct block, your level will increment. Each level tells you how many characters will appear; you must press on these blocks in the correct order that they appear in in order to advance to the next level. 

Happy tapping!
